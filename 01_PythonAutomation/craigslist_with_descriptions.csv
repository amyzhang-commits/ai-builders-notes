Dual Distrib is a two-channel video distribution amplifier for the eurorack video modular format, with three independent outputs for each input.  Each input and output is fully compatible with video industry standard 75 ohm video signals, and each output is fully isolated with its own independent op-amp for maximum reliability and signal stability. Composite and Component video signals can be fickle, requiring proper 75 ohm termination to guarantee the best possible image quality.  When you have one video source to send to two or more receiving device inputs using a splitter cable doesn‚Äôt work very well, and a distribution amplifier is required.  There are stand-alone devices already available to do this, but this 4HP module mounts conveniently in your rack, saving space and avoiding the need for an external plug-pack to power it!
